                            <p>Direct translation of  Kaitiakitanga - A person, group, or being that acts as a guardian or protector to something else e.g. Land, Tapu, Taunga, or Ancestors, someone who carries out an action. 
                            But there is deeper meaning than what was explained here.
                            Guardianship, protection, preservation. Guardianship over tapu like pounamu, and sacred things.
                            Kaitiakitanga is spiritual/physical guardianship over a person or thing. 
                            It can be being a mother, older sibling, or teacher. This means you are a kaitiaki for others.
                            Things like pounamu are usually very special to people, since it is a very rare stone
                            Another example is that we are kaitiaki over wellingtonâ€™s streams and environment, which means we need to take care of it.</p>

                            <p>California's ancient sequoia defies scientists' expectations and grows new buds from its blackened trunk
                                Where: California is Big Basin Redwoods State Park
                                Who: Drew Peltier, a tree ecophysiologist at Northern Arizona University
                                Why: lightning-induced
                                What: California's redwoods were thought to never recover from a fire caused by a lightning strike, but within a few weeks new buds have sprouted.
                                When: AUG 2023
                                There is hope that this MAHI will recover even if California is redwoods die due to fires caused by global warming.</p>
