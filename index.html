But there is deeper meaning than what was explained here.Guardianship, protection, preservation. Guardianship over tapu like pounamu, and sacred things.Kaitiakitanga is spiritual/physical guardianship over a person or thing. It can be being a mother, older sibling, or teacher. This means you are a kaitiaki for others.Things like pounamu are usually very special to people, since it is a very rare stone. Another example is that we are kaitiaki over wellingtonâ€™s streams and environment, which means we need to take care of it.",
