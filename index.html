If you maintain it well it will run for a long time without much money to spare  and a lot of profit, and   even environmentalists are supporting nuclear power today. Like this more and more countries have started or going to build more nuclear power plants. Of course, nuclear power plants werenâ€™t the best choice in the old days when there were a thousand lights and you would have to tell what was wrong when one of the lights went off, but in this day and time is different you can tell what is wrong, the second something goes wrong it  will show  you what is and where is  the problem.",
