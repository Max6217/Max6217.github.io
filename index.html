<p> Direct translation of  Kaitiakitanga - A person, group, or being that acts as a guardian or protector to something else e.g. Land, Tapu, Taunga, or Ancestors, someone who carries out an action. 
But there is deeper meaning than what was explained here.
Guardianship, protection, preservation. Guardianship over tapu like pounamu, and sacred things.
Kaitiakitanga is spiritual/physical guardianship over a person or thing. 
It can be being a mother, older sibling, or teacher. This means you are a kaitiaki for others.
Things like pounamu are usually very special to people, since it is a very rare stone
Another example is that we are kaitiaki over wellingtonâ€™s streams and environment, which means we need to take care of it.
