                            <p>Direct translation of  Kaitiakitanga - A person, group, or being that acts as a guardian or protector to something else e.g. Land, Tapu, Taunga, or Ancestors, someone who carries out an action. 
                            But there is deeper meaning than what was explained here.
                            Guardianship, protection, preservation. Guardianship over tapu like pounamu, and sacred things.
                            Kaitiakitanga is spiritual/physical guardianship over a person or thing. 
                            It can be being a mother, older sibling, or teacher. This means you are a kaitiaki for others.
                            Things like pounamu are usually very special to people, since it is a very rare stone
                            Another example is that we are kaitiaki over wellington’s streams and environment, which means we need to take care of it.</p>

                                <p>Who: Orange Sky was founded in Australia by two 20-year-old mates, Nic Marchesi, and Lucas Patchett.
                                <li>Where: Orange Sky has vans to go around the city to find homeless people, Orange Sky has about 29 vans around NZ and Australia where they operate. 250 locations each week. Also, they have restaurants helping. A guy with a shopping cart asks restaurants for any food they are willing to give to the homeless.</li>
                                <li>What: Ornage Sky Aoteroa</li>
                                <li>Why: What started as an idea to improve hygiene standards and restore dignity to people doing it tough has evolved into something much bigger and more powerful.</li>
                                <li>When: Orange Sky was founded on the 4th of September 2014 by Nic Marchesi, Lucas Patchett</li>
                                <li>How: Their idea "started as a fun test project to see if it would work. From there, it took a life of its own.” They took the name for their service from the Alexi Murdoch song "Orange Sky", which is about lending a hand to those in need. Orange Sky Laundry is a government-registered charity.</li>
                                <li>What hope does this mahi give us for the future?</li>
                                <li>The campaign has been very effective with over 13,700 people who helped in the past 12 months and have had 67,000 hours of genuine conversations with the homeless, 6,300 showers, and 35,000 loads of laundry. They have been very successful in the campaign and are helping many people. In conclusion, I have lots of hope for the future.</li></p>
