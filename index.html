                            <p>Direct translation of  Kaitiakitanga - A person, group, or being that acts as a guardian or protector to something else e.g. Land, Tapu, Taunga, or Ancestors, someone who carries out an action. 
                            But there is deeper meaning than what was explained here.
                            Guardianship, protection, preservation. Guardianship over tapu like pounamu, and sacred things.
                            Kaitiakitanga is spiritual/physical guardianship over a person or thing. 
                            It can be being a mother, older sibling, or teacher. This means you are a kaitiaki for others.
                            Things like pounamu are usually very special to people, since it is a very rare stone
                            Another example is that we are kaitiaki over wellington’s streams and environment, which means we need to take care of it.</p>

                            <p>Nuclear energy

                                There are a lot of people and groups that sport nuclear energy. And decades-old fusion reactor is in use to this day, and without one nuclear meltdown as well(Good News Network,). If you maintain it well it will run for a long time without much money to spare  and a lot of profit, and   even environmentalists are supporting nuclear power today. Like this more and more countries have started or going to build more nuclear power plants. Of course, nuclear power plants weren’t the best choice in the old days when there were a thousand lights and you would have to tell what was wrong when one of the lights went off, but in this day and time is different you can tell what is wrong, the second something goes wrong it  will show  you what is and where is  the problem.
